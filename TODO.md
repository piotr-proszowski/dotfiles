# TODO

I put on this list things that are not yet done and are somehow cumbersome for me (everything that needs mouse usage goes here for sure).

review in vim hangs when there are bigger files
- review in vim - colors like github
- Slack - control only with keyboard
- kibana CLI
- static imports (In IntelliJ it's done via context help...) in VIM
- Better syntax highlighing in vim
- CLI tool for fetching depenedncies from mvnrepository
