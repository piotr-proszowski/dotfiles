# My dotfiles repo

Inspired by post http://iamnotmyself.com/2020/11/10/your-terminal-and-you-dotfiles/ I decided to create my own dotfiles repository. Which leads me step by step to my favourite terminal configuration about which you can read here: https://proszkie.github.io/.

! IN PROGRESS !

## Installing 

After cloning this repo run

```
bash install.sh
```
