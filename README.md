# My dotfiles repo

Inspired by post http://iamnotmyself.com/2020/11/10/your-terminal-and-you-dotfiles/. I decided to create my own dotfiles repository which leads me step by step to my favourite terminal configuration about which you can read here: https://proszkie.github.io/posts/awesome-cli/.
 
! IN PROGRESS !

## Installing 

After cloning this repo run `install.sh`

```
bash install.sh
```
